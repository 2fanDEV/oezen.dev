As I already mentioned I still go to university

After passing all exams there is only one mountain 
left. 

The bachelor thesis. 

Now currently at the moment I'm not interested 
in pursuing a masters degree. I'd rather 
try to get more practical experience for 
half a year to a year before I finally decide
if I want to do the masters degree. 

Since I still think I have to learn more about 
programming I decided to do this website as 
a learning experience.
